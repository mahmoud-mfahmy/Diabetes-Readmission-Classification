# Diabetes-Readmission-Classification
Using classification methods to predict hospital readmission for diabetic patients

## Summary:
* Dataset consists of 10 years of diabetic patients' data in the U.S., along with whether or they not they were readmitted to the hospital
* Data was cleaned and many of the features were recoded/engineered
* Multiple classification models were compared using R (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest) as well as K-Means Clustering
* Logistic regression was found to be the best model
